     * /themes/currenttheme/modules/users/extensions directories for
	 * a list of installed User Profile Extension class files.  It returns the class
	 * names, in an array. This function does not take into account whether or not
	 * the administrator has activated or deactivated certain profiles.

	 * In order to be picked up by this function (and therefore the rest of the Users
	 * subsystem) a profile extension filename MUST end in 'extension.php', and
	 * therefore the classname MUST end in 'extension'.

	 * Returns an array of installed (but not necessarily activated) user profile
	 *    extensions.  If this array is empty, either Exponent encountered a problem
	 *    reading the Profile Extensions directory, or there were simply no extensions
	 *    to list.
