## What does it do?


This class manages file uploads for you. In short, it manages the uploaded file, and allows you to do whatever you want with the file, especially if it is an image, and as many times as you want.

It is the ideal class to quickly integrate file upload in your site. If the file is an image, you can convert, resize, crop it in many ways. You can also apply filters, add borders, text, watermarks, etc... That's all you need for a gallery script for instance. Supported formats are PNG, JPG, GIF and BMP.

You can also use the class to work on local files, which is especially useful to use the image manipulation features. The class also supports Flash uploaders and XMLHttpRequest.

The class works with PHP 4, 5 and 7, and its error messages can be localized at will.




## Install via composer

Edit your composer.json file to include the following:

```
    {
       "require": {
           "verot/class.upload.php": "dev-master"
       }
    }
```

## Demo and examples

Check out the `test/` directory, which you can load in your browser. You can test the class and its different ways to instantiate it, see some code examples, and run some tests.



## How to use it?

Create a simple HTML file, with a form such as:
```html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="upload.php">
  <input type="file" size="32" name="image_field" value="">
  <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="upload">
</form>
```
Create a file called upload.php (into which you have first loaded the class):
```php
$handle = new upload($_FILES['image_field']);
if ($handle->uploaded) {
  $handle->file_new_name_body   = 'image_resized';
  $handle->image_resize         = true;
  $handle->image_x              = 100;
  $handle->image_ratio_y        = true;
  $handle->process('/home/user/files/');
  if ($handle->processed) {
    echo 'image resized';
    $handle->clean();
  } else {
    echo 'error : ' . $handle->error;
  }
}
```


### How does it work?

You instanciate the class with the `$_FILES['my_field']` array where _my_field_ is the field name from your upload form. The class will check if the original file has been uploaded to its temporary location (alternatively, you can instanciate the class with a local filename).

You can then set a number of processing variables to act on the file. For instance, you can rename the file, and if it is an image, convert and resize it in many ways. You can also set what will the class do if the file already exists.

Then you call the function `process()` to actually perform the actions according to the processing parameters you set above. It will create new instances of the original file, so the original file remains the same between each process. The file will be manipulated, and copied to the given location. The processing variables will be reset once it is done.

You can repeat setting up a new set of processing variables, and calling `process()` again as many times as you want. When you have finished, you can call `clean()` to delete the original uploaded file.

If you don't set any processing parameters and call `process()` just after instanciating the class. The uploaded file will be simply copied to the given location without any alteration or checks.

Don't forget to add `enctype="multipart/form-data"` in your form tag `<form>` if you want your form to upload the file.



### How to process a file uploaded via XMLHttpRequest?

Use the class as following, the rest being the same as above:

```php
$handle = new upload('php:'.$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FILE_NAME']);
```

Prefixing the argument with _php:_ tells the class to retrieve the uploaded data in _php://input_, and the rest is the stream's filename, which is generally in `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FILE_NAME']`. But you can use any other name you see fit:

```php
$handle = new upload('php:mycustomname.ext');
```

### How to process local files?

Use the class as following, the rest being the same as above:

```php
$handle = new upload('/home/user/myfile.jpg');
```

### How to set the language?

Instantiate the class with a second argument being the language code:

```php
$handle = new upload($_FILES['image_field'], 'fr_FR');
$handle = new upload('/home/user/myfile.jpg', 'fr_FR');
```

### How to output the resulting file or picture directly to the browser?

Simply call `process()` without an argument (or with null as first argument):

```php
$handle = new upload($_FILES['image_field']);
header('Content-type: ' . $handle->file_src_mime);
echo $handle->Process();
die();
```

Or if you want to force the download of the file:

```php
$handle = new upload($_FILES['image_field']);
header('Content-type: ' . $handle->file_src_mime);
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=".rawurlencode($handle->file_src_name).";");
echo $handle->Process();
die();
```

**v 0.23** 23/12/2006
