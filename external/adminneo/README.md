AdminNeo
==========

**AdminNeo** is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. It consists of a single file ready to deploy 
to the target server. As a companion, **EditorNeo** offers data manipulation for end-users.

AdminNeo is based on the [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) project by Jakub Vrána.
