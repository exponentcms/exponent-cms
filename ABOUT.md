##Introduction
============

The Exponent Team is pleased to announce the release of Exponent Content Management System
version 2.0 - Content Management Made Simple.

The culmination of over several years of R&D and user community input,
Exponent offers many features found in other systems (both open source and 
proprietary). 

However, Exponent stands for Content Management Made Simple.

Exponent brings a number of innovative approaches to problems found in other 
content management systems, and brings useful features lacking in others. 

###Exponent is completely self-contained

Unlike other site management tools, no additional applications need to be 
downloaded by a user to permit them to use Exponent. Everything, from user 
management, to site configuration, to content editing (and content approval 
for large, multi-admin sites), is done within the system - simply. Exponent 
does what other CMS systems do - it allows permitted users to create website 
pages, content on pages, and manage where these pages are placed on a website
- but it does all this in a completely new way.

###Easy-to-use at any skill level

Exponent uses an intuitive and flexible content editing system that allows 
website pages to be edited on the page as it is displayed - no more back-end 
administration, no more navigating endless administration pages to add a simple 
line of text - simply visit the page you need to edit as if you were a site 
visitor, and make the change with an inline WYSIWYG editor which makes 
formatting text and images a snap. 

###Why users, developers, designers and administrators alike love Exponent

Exponent is modular, but flexible. Content can be mirrored through a site and 
edited in any instance or copy from any page that the content is placed on, 
or simply created as unique content. Multiple site themes and CSS stylesheets 
are easily integrated, and sub-themes (separate frameworks for content within 
a common appearance or theme) are possible with minimum fuss. A large range 
of different content modules can be activated via the admin interface with 
ease and used, other community-supported modules uploaded and installed 
automatically in a few moments, and external scripts can be incorporated with 
ease. Exponent's framework also rewards developers who need to create their 
own custom solutions. 

###Exponent is Open Source

Exponent is created for the community, by the community. Exponent developers 
support the Exponent Project because they believe in not only the system as 
a new and radically different CMS offering, but also because they appreciate 
its underlying simplicity and common sense. 

###Exponent is the next generation CMS for everyone

Please refer to the CHANGELOG for a full list of new Exponent features, and
a list of features coming up in future releases.

Thank you for using Exponent!
