-----------------------
# Attachable Items are no longer included “for free” when instantiating expRecord and subclasses (for speed and optimization). It’s now up to the developer to specify the particular attachable item types in the $attachable_item_types array.
# No longer toggling magnification upon toggling upon toggling error reporting (DEVELOPMENT, 1). “Toggle Minify” is now located in the Slingbar under Exponent > Developer Tools > Toggle Minify.
# Minified Style Sheets are no longer stored in tmp/css/exp-styles-min.css. Exponent now uses the built-in caching system built in to Minify.
# No longer reading CSS files from themes/common/css
# Core system assets (css, images, javascript) are now located in framework/core/assets
# Module assets are kept in framework/modules/$module/assets/[css/javascript/images]
# PHP YUI Loader is now used to calculate YUI 2 and 3 dependencies on the server-side, rather than the YUI JS Loader.
# exponent_theme_headerInfo() has been deprecated for expTheme::head().
# The $config array passed to expTheme::head($config) has changed.
# exponent_theme_main() has been deprecated in favor of expTheme::main();
# exponent_theme_showModule(), exponent_theme_showSectionalModule(), exponent_theme_showTopSectionalModule(), and expTheme::showController() have all been deprecated in favor of expTheme::module();
# The Default WYSIWYG Editor has been changed to CKEditor.
# The current toolbar builder isn’t GUI friendly, but moderately easy learning curve. look at : http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Toolbar for creating your own editor configuration. You’ll only want what’s inside the initial square braces “[“.
# A close button has been added to the message queue.
# New Administrative Chrome styles.
# The “This Page and This Modules” menu in the Slingbar has been renamed to “Pages” and is no longer context sensitive to alleviate confusion.
# Many architectural adjustments within core-level code we made for speed, optimization, and overall compatibility reasons.
# Many module’s views and styles have been adjusted as we continue to nail down module development patterns and best practices.
# Many “old school” (1.0 codeline) modules have been removed from the distributed package for incompatibility reasons.
# “Site Configuration” within the Slingbar’s Exponent > Configure > Configure Site option has been overhauled and made more user friendly.
# The savability of site configurations has been removed (so back up conf/config.php manually if you ever used that feature).
