Exponent CMS 2.0 is an exciting web-based content management system. It makes
creating and maintaining websites easy for non-technical users, while
providing site managers the power and flexibility to add new features,
completely customize the layout, and delegate responsibilities to other
users.

---------------
Getting Started

First, you'll need to install and configure Exponent. See the INSTALLATION
file for a detailed description of how to do this.
